Our implementation includes four files: TCPend.java, TCPsegment.java, TCPreceiver.java, TCPsender.java

TCPend is the main program which addresses command line arguments.
TCPsender runs on the server side.
TCPreceiver runs on the client side.
TCPsegment is the data segment that encapsulated in the java DatagramPacket. It is used for data exchange 
between server and client.
